## Core Task: Project Replacement

### Objective
Replace the "Customer Satisfaction Analysis" project with "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews" while maintaining perfect visual consistency with the existing design.

### Required Changes

#### 1. File Operations
- **REMOVE**: `/Users/johndattoma/Google Drive/portfolio/docs/outputs/customer_satisfaction.html`
- **ADD**: `/Users/johndattoma/Google Drive/portfolio/docs/outputs/aspect_sentiment.html`

#### 2. index.html Updates
- **Hyperlink Update**: Change link from `customer_satisfaction.html` → `aspect_sentiment.html`
- **Label Change**: "Customer Satisfaction Analysis" → "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews"
- **Image Update**: Replace with placeholder image using `https://via.placeholder.com/300x200`
- **Dimensions**: Ensure placeholder matches existing card image dimensions

#### 3. Visual Consistency Requirements
- **CRITICAL**: Match the color palette, fonts, card dimensions, and shadows from the provided screenshot
- **CSS Analysis**: Examine existing CSS classes and IDs for project cards
- **Design Reference**: Use `/Users/johndattoma/Google Drive/portfolio/Screenshot 2025-05-29 at 4.44.50 PM.png`

## Workflow Instructions

### Phase 1: Analysis
1. Read the current `index.html` file
2. Examine the screenshot to understand the design system
3. Identify the CSS classes and styling for project cards
4. Locate the specific card element for "Customer Satisfaction Analysis"
5. Locate the "Consumer Insights Analysis" card for updating
6. Read `/Users/johndattoma/Google Drive/portfolio/docs/outputs/efile.html` to extract relevant content

### Phase 2: Planning
Before making changes:
- Create a comprehensive plan for all updates
- Identify all elements that need modification
- Plan the Consumer Insights Analysis card updates based on efile.html content
- Confirm the visual styling approach
- Map out all files that need path verification

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. Update the hyperlink path (customer_satisfaction.html → aspect_sentiment.html)
2. Change the project title/label to "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews"
3. Update Consumer Insights Analysis card with information from efile.html
4. Replace the image with placeholder
5. Ensure CSS classes remain consistent
6. Verify visual styling matches the reference

### Phase 4: Path Verification & Debugging
**CRITICAL PHASE - Must be completed thoroughly**
1. **Figure Path Verification**: 
   - Scan all HTML files linked from index.html
   - Ensure all figure/image paths point to `/Users/johndattoma/Google Drive/portfolio/docs/graphs`
   - Fix any incorrect figure paths
2. **Link Validation**:
   - Test all hyperlinks in index.html
   - Verify all linked HTML files exist and are accessible
   - Fix any broken links
3. **File Path Correction**:
   - Check all relative and absolute file paths
   - Ensure consistency across all files
   - Update any outdated or incorrect paths

### Phase 5: Final Verification
1. Review the updated `index.html`
2. Confirm all changes are complete
3. Validate visual consistency
4. **Run comprehensive debugging check**:
   - All links functional ✅
   - All figures display correctly ✅
   - All file paths work ✅
5. Provide the final updated file(s)

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Maintain existing CSS class naming conventions
- Preserve responsive design patterns
- Keep accessibility attributes intact

## Quality Standards
- **Visual Consistency**: New card must be indistinguishable from existing cards in terms of styling
- **Functional Links**: All hyperlinks must work correctly
- **Clean Code**: Maintain readable, well-structured HTML
- **No Broken Elements**: Preserve all existing functionality

## Tools Available
- File editing capabilities

✅ All hyperlinks in index.html work correctly  
✅ All linked HTML files are accessible  
✅ All file paths are correct and functional  
✅ All existing functionality preserved  
✅ Comprehensive debugging completed successfully  

## Important Notes
- **Screenshot Reference**: Always refer to the provided screenshot for design consistency
- **File Paths**: Use exact file paths as specified
- **Consumer Insights Source**: Extract content from `/Users/johndattoma/Google Drive/portfolio/docs/outputs/efile.html`
- **Figure Directory**: All figures must point to `/Users/johndattoma/Google Drive/portfolio/docs/graphs`
- **Placeholder Dimensions**: Match existing card image sizes exactly
- **CSS Preservation**: Do not modify existing CSS classes unless necessary for consistency
- **Debugging Priority**: Path verification and link validation are CRITICAL - must be completed thoroughly
- **Comprehensive Check**: Every HTML file linked from index.html must be verified for correct paths

## Output Requirements
Provide the complete, updated `index.html` file ready for immediate use. The file should be fully functional with all changes implemented, visually consistent with the existing portfolio design, and with all paths and links verified to work correctly.
